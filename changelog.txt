Current work in progress:
	- Implemented a version command
	- Add support for multiple flash types (added 29LV320 and S29JL032)
	- Disables write protect (sets mapper FFFC bit 7) when programming
	- Add "bc" (blank check) command, to check if the FLASH (not the
	auto-detected "ROM" size) is blank.
	- Add "setromsize" command, to force a different size than what init detected.

February 2021: Release 1.0
	- Auto-detect ROM size
	- Read ROM
	- Write Flash
